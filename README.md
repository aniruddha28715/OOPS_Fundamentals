# OOPS_Fundamentals

### OOPS IN JAVA:
Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.
Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.

OOPS is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

### *Object*
-Any entity that has a state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.
An Object can be defined as an instance of a class.

### *Class*
-The collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
(blueprint)

### *Inheritance*
-When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

### *Polymorphism*
-If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

### *Abstraction*
-Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.

### *Encapsulation*
-Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. 

### *Coupling*
-Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other.
